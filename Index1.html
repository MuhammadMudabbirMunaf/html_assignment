            Facebook is defined as an online social networking website where people can create profiles, share information such as photos and quotes<br>
            about themselves, and respond or link to the information posted by others. A social-networking web site, founded in 2004 and
             <br> originally known as The Facebook.</p>
            <p>Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg<br> 
             with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes 
             from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students,
             gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 
             2.8 billion monthly active users,[2] and ranked seventh in global internet usage.[6][needs update] It was the most downloaded 
             mobile app of the 2010s.[7]</p>
            <p>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, 
            users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other
             users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each 
             other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the 
             pages they follow.</p>
